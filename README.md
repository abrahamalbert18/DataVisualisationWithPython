# Data Visualisation With Python

In this repository, I intend to practice the art of story telling with the 
help of data visualisation using python. Visualisation libraries include 
_Seaborn_, _Matplotlib_, _Dash_.

The datasets and practice questions are based on the exercises of the 
following course offered by Duke University: [Data Visualisation 
With Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization-python/)
